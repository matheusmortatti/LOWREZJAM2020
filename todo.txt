MVC

- enemy spawn
	- wave based or randomized? Could be both?
	- will there be a win scenario or just score based?

- arena boundaries
	- how would enemies move
	- any better art than all black?

- player buffs
        - how do we show player/NPC remaining health, or should we?
                (would be nice if it's embedded in the sprite and not just a bar, but that's a plus)
        - should buffers have a timer? Not sure.

- main menu
	- also name

Nice to have extras

- art revamp
	- lore? Possibilities: space gladiator :: purgatory spirits :: masquerade ball dance
	- music
	- cool main menu
	- tutorial text (can we write in PICO-8 font out of the box?)

- test different control schemes

- boss fight
	- Ok now I'm just dreaming
